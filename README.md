# SEDC Project Mentorship üöÄ

## Welcome üëã
Welcome to the SEDC Project Mentorship programme. We are very happy to see so many submitted projects and ideas. This repository will be the main hub for information, announcements and helpful links and resources that you will need through out the course of this period of time. 
### Goal  ü•á
The goal of this programme is for every team to create a product, an application that will show their skills and determination to build stuff and to advance in their field. Students will have full control over the projects and the development process. This means that the final product will be a project completely designed and devoted by the students. The process will be monitored by the mentors and they will provide help and feedback when things get confusing and rough. Doing these projects do have benefits including: 
* Learn to be part of Agile team
* Learn to use industry standard tooling
* Learn to work on open source project / product
* Learn to deploy to publicly available location 
* Get technical mentorship 
* Start building personal CV with IT project involvement

## Timeline üóì
* 1st semester, 1 track
  * Frontend JavaScript Web Development (G1-G8)
* 2nd semester, 2 tracks
  * Backend / Full-stack .NET Web Development (G1-G7)

## Project types üéà
* Client project
  * Get refined client needs (BA)
  * Implement front-end part of a website (DEV)

  * Implement front-end part of a web-based product (DEV)
  * Confirm product features are completed (ST)

## Team Structure for Client projects üí™
For the teams that will work on client projects the teams will be organized: 
* Students
  * 4-6 x Web Developers
  * 1-2 x Software Testers
  * 1 x Team representative ( Picked from the people already in the team )
* Technical mentors
  * Web Design
  * Web Development

### Mentor responsibility üì¢
A mentors responsibility will be to guide and assist the students through out the process of design and development of the projects. This can be done through giving students feedback, consult on issues and give directions when the students get stuck or have some dilemma about the project, the code or the idea in general. Every team will have a chance to contact the mentor and ask for a feedback, but since the goal is to build an independent project, this feedback will be limited to:
* 1 x technical mentorship feedback during initial kick-off meeting
* 3 x technical mentorship feedback related to overcoming technical issues during development / execution of monthly demo
* 1 x technical mentorship feedback related to application final touches and project phase closure

### Team responsibility ‚öΩ
The team responsibility will be to plan the course of the development process for their project. A team member needs to spend at least 40 to 60 hours on the project. Because there are multiple members, this number is multiplied by the number of team members. Every team member needs to have a part in the project and need to present their work when the presentation day comes

### Documentation of project üìù
Documenting the project is important. The code should be uploaded and updated frequently on github. But documentation on the goals and aims of the project are also important. To get the feel on how to write a good README for your project and document it, here is a template and an example:
